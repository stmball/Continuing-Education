    "# Week 6 - Modules and Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers are lazy - we like making things easier for ourselves by writing for loops to automate processes for us, and create classes and other structures to make sense of complex data. Perhaps the biggest and best form of laziness in programming is the idea of sharing code with peers in the form of *libraries*\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries are collections of code created by other people that can be bought into Python on demand to solve problems or make our lives significantly easier. These libraries can be small, low level packages that interact with fundamental Python objects (`socket` for example, provides very low level networking code), to extremely elaborate packages that run websites (`flask`, `django`) or build deep learning neural network models (`pytorch`, `tensorflow`).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also publish our own code to the public Python repository (a sort of meta-library containing information of all other libraries) through a publication process, while still being allowed to use other people's libarires (if licence allows); building a dependency tree that Python automatically resolves when attempting to install. Unfortunately this is a bit invoved and not really feasible to do from Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we'll do a deep dive into what a library is; how to install them; some helpful ones to get started with, and some examples of what problems these let us solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Library?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Libraries*, *modules*, *packages* - these names are all pretty much interchangable. These all reference code that we import into Python somehow that allows us to piggy-back on what someone else has written. This code is usually normal Python written by mortals like you or I; and maintained by an army of voluenteers. By default, Python will look at the public python index at https://pypi.org - this is an index of all the publically published Python libaries that exist, and we can find all the \"big players\" here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also self-host a Python package index for private packages to share code within a company. How this is achieved isn't really too important for now but just know that Python does not for all packages to be made publically available, but it's \"in the spirit\" of programming to share your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "As with anything in Python, libaries are an object with a type and methods:"

    "\n",
    "## How do we install Libraries?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some libraries in Python are built in (such as `datetime` above), and don't need any installation process to work. These come with Python and are only not available by default to speed some things up - we don't always need to send an email or make low level network connections if we're just doing some maths!\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colab comes with an additional fantastic suite of libraries pre-installed that are somewhat geared towards data science. In Colab, we can import these just like any built in library. We'll see how to view the installed libraries in just a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to install libraries that we don't have installed, we use the command line `pip` tool. This tool is what we mainly use for installing, managing and creating Python packages, although wrappers around this tool exist to make our lives a bit easier in certain circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FIRST: A Note on using the Command Line in Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we will want to run terminal commands in Colab rather than Python - these are system commands used to manage the server we are on. Normally, with a local Python installation, this is the default interface (rather than Python) - however in a Jupyter notebook we have to use the following syntax to run commands:"

It can be hard to how to oragnise your projects, but this simply takes time and experience. Personally, I start with a library and write everything as classes, and as certain themes become more important they get their own file.\n",

All the packages in these exercises have excellent documentation (some packages less so!), so this should be fine.\n",

    "* Take in a user's input for their date of birth, and calculate how many seconds they've been alive\n",

    "### Using Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "The `collections` library gives us some helpful datastructures out of the box that we can abuse to solve some very complex problems. Write a function to solve the following problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A few weeks ago we wrote some code to check if two words are anagrams of one another - using `Counters` you should be able to rewrite this into a lot simpler code\n",
    "* Another actual job interview question: write a function that takes in a list of strings, and outputs the number of unique anagram groups from that list. For example `[\"dog\", \"god\", \"apple\"]` would return 2, since `dog` and `god` form one anagram group, and `apple` the second.\n",
    "*  The `Counter` object is actually a specific case of the `defaultdict` object. This object allows for creations of dictionaries with a default initial parameter for when we try and index a value that doesn't exist. We are in charge of a HR department for a small startup that has the following departments: Data, Security, Finance, HR, Management and Development. We are asked to build a program that given a list of employees and departments, outputs a dictionary that contains each department as a key and their relevant employees. However - if a department has no employees, when indexed it should just give an empty list.\n",

    "* With the above code, also create a function for bingo cards - containing 25 numbers randomly chosen from 1 to 99. \n",
    "* Finally, write a program that starts a bingo game with `n` people, generates a bingo card for each one, and starts the bingo game. When all the numbers on one person's card are checked off, that person should be declared a winner and the game stopped.\n"
