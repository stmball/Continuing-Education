Google Colab runs *jupyter notebooks*, which is a kind of Python environment that mixes Markdown (a kind of text language for writing notes like these!), and Python cells.

This will run the cell and create a new Python cell below to run code. This cell-based way of running code is particularly helpful for exploring code as Jupyter remembers all the information declared in previously ran cells.\n",

    "# Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of these exercises is to get you comfortable with entering code into notebooks and experiementing with the results. I *highly* encourage you to go off-piste with all the exercises in the course and go crazy with it. My favourite emails are the ones where people take the exercises somewhere else!\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, this week's exercises are pretty simple as it's about getting familar with the enviroment and building confidence with entering code. Like learning any language, practice is the way to fluency, but don't feel the need to complete every single exercise if you feel like you completely get it. Try something else!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables and Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create two variables with appropriate names to track the number of apples and number of oranges in a basket, and give them two appropriate values.\n",
    "2) *By using the variables you've just defined*, overwrite the values of the above given the current things happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I give you 3 apples.\n",
    "* I take away 2 oranges.\n",
    "* I double the amount of oranges you have.\n",
    "* I ask you to distribute your apples equally between 4 other people - any apples you have that can't be split evenly, you keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Set a new variable with an appropriate name to the total number of fruits you have.\n",
    "4) What is the proportion of apples to oranges you have?\n",
    "5) After sucessfully running your fruit counting business for a few years, the number of fruits you work with starts to increase dramatically; but since you're a Python expert, you can still manage your stock levels! You now have `1298371` bananas and `238764384` mangos. Assign these two numbers to two more variables with sensible names.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You have quite a lot of mangos. You decide to box them up into boxes of 12. How many boxes do you have? Assign this to a new variable.\n",
    "* You really want to shift these boxes of mangos, so decide to run a promotion where for each banana sold, customers get a number of boxes of mangos. What is the maximum amount of boxes of mangos you can give per banana guaranteeing that you don't run out of boxes? Then, if you sell out of bananas with this deal, how many boxes will you have left over?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists and Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create a list and assign it to a variable with at least 6 elements, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One string\n",
    "* One boolean object\n",
    "* One sublist of at least length 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) From your list, retrieve the third element\n",
    "3) From your list, retrieve the string\n",
    "4) From your list, retrieve the second element of the sublist\n",
    "5) Get the 2nd through to the 5th sublist of your list.\n",
    "6) Get the backwards version of your list. Is the sublist reversed as well?\n",
    "7) Get every even-indexed element of your list (0 is even)\n",
    "8) Add the string `\"orange\"` to the end of your list.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Now create a dictionary with the following information, using suitable key labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your name\n",
    "* Your favourite colour\n",
    "* Your favourite number\n",
    "* If you prefer dogs to cats (`True` if dogs, `False` if cats)\n",

    "There's going to be a section every week where I ask you to investigate some Python that we didn't explicitly talk about during the session. Don't be afraid to Google things you don't understand, or send me an email - the point of this section is to get you exploring Python yourself a bit more and building confidence for independent work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another data structure we didn't look at that is worth considering - the set. Sets are like lists but with some differences: duplicates are *not allowed* in sets, and they are unordered, unindexable and the elements cannot be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a list, we use curly brackets (`{}`) like a dictionary, but only provide items rather than key value pairs separated by colons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create a set, attempting to add duplicate items and `print` the result.\n",
    "2) Using the `dir` command, or Google, try and find the way to add elements to the set (it's not `.append()`!)\n",
    "3) Sets are used in many cases where we want to compare if two groups both contain the same elements, without caring how many of said element exists. Consider the two sets below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}\n",
    "b = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you find a way to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the numbers that are in both `a` and `b`?\n",
    "* Create a new set from `a` and `b` containing all numbers in both `a` and `b`?\n",
    "* Create a new set from `a` without any elements that are in `b`?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "The other builtin data structure in Python is the Tuple. Tuples are like lists, but are immutable (cannot be changed after defining them). They're helpful in cases where we know the data structure is definetely not going to change. Tuples are defined in the same way as lists, but using round brackets `()` instead of square brackets `[]`. \n",
